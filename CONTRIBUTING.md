Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the proposed enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternative solutions you've considered**

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Write tests first** - We follow TDD practices
3. **Ensure your code passes all tests** - Run `npm test`
4. **Maintain code coverage** - We aim for >90% coverage
5. **Follow the code style** - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`
6. **Update documentation** - Keep README and docs in sync
7. **Write clear commit messages** - Follow conventional commits when possible

## Development Process

### Setup Your Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/newrelic-mcp.git
cd newrelic-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Set up your .env file for testing
cp .env.example .env
# Add your New Relic credentials
```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We follow TDD practices. Always write tests before implementing features:

1. **Write a failing test** that defines the desired behavior
2. **Write minimal code** to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** for each piece of functionality

Example workflow:
```bash
# 1. Write your test
npm test -- --watch

# 2. Implement the feature
# 3. Ensure tests pass
npm test

# 4. Check coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Style Guidelines

This project uses **Biome** for linting and formatting:

- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Semicolons** always required
- **100 character** line width maximum

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Auto-fix formatting issues
npm run format

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for comprehensive edge case coverage

#### Integration Tests
- Test tool integration with New Relic API
- Use `USE_REAL_ENV=true` for real API tests
- Ensure proper error handling

#### BDD Tests
- Write Gherkin features for user scenarios
- Located in `test/features/`
- Run with `npm run test:bdd`

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Update tool descriptions in the server
- Include examples for new features

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool:

1. **Define the tool specification** in the appropriate file under `src/tools/`
2. **Implement the tool logic** with proper input validation
3. **Write comprehensive tests** including unit and integration tests
4. **Update the server** to register the new tool
5. **Document the tool** in README.md and add examples
6. **Test with MCP Inspector** to ensure proper integration

Example tool structure:
```typescript
export class MyNewTool {
  constructor(private client: NewRelicClient) {}

  get tool(): Tool {
    return {
      name: 'my_new_tool',
      description: 'Clear description of what this tool does',
      inputSchema: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          // Define inputs with Zod schemas
        },
        required: ['requiredField']
      }
    };
  }

  async execute(input: any): Promise<MyToolResult> {
    // Validate input
    // Call New Relic API
    // Process response
    // Return structured result
  }
}
```
