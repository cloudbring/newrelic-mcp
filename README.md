# New Relic MCP Server

 [![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@cloudbring/newrelic-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/servers/cloudbring/newrelic-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with New Relic's observability platform. Query metrics, manage alerts, monitor applications, and interact with your entire observability stack through a simple, unified interface.

> **Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial community project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by New Relic, Inc. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

## Features

- 📊 **NRQL Queries** - Execute powerful queries to analyze your data
- 🚀 **APM Integration** - Monitor application performance and health
- 🔔 **Alert Management** - View and acknowledge alerts and incidents  
- 🔍 **Entity Search** - Discover and inspect entities across your infrastructure
- 📈 **Synthetics Monitoring** - Manage synthetic monitors and checks
- 🔧 **NerdGraph API** - Direct access to New Relic's GraphQL API
- 🌐 **REST v2 Tools (2.0+)** - High‑value REST endpoints for deployments, APM apps, metrics, and alerts

## Installation

### npx (quickest)

The package runs directly from npm — no install step:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=your-key npx -y newrelic-mcp
```

EU-region accounts: also set `NEW_RELIC_REGION=EU`.

### MCP Registry

Listed in the official [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as
`io.github.cloudbring/newrelic-mcp` — clients and directories that sync from the
registry (e.g. PulseMCP) pick it up from there. Server metadata lives in
[`server.json`](./server.json).

### Smithery

The [Smithery listing](https://smithery.ai/servers/cloudbring/newrelic-mcp) predates
Smithery's move away from hosted stdio servers; the modern equivalent of the old
`@smithery/cli install` flow is:

```bash
npx smithery mcp add @cloudbring/newrelic-mcp
```

(The `smithery.yaml`/`smithery.json` files in this repo are from the 2025 deploy
model and are kept for the listing's history.)

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Connection Issues</summary>

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Verify your API key is valid:

   For US region:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -d '{"query":"{ actor { user { email } } }"}'
   ```

   For EU region:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -d '{"query":"{ actor { user { email } } }"}'
   ```

2. Check that your Account ID is correct
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
4. Check the MCP client logs for detailed error messages

</details>

<details>
<summary>Permission Errors</summary>

If you receive permission errors:

1. Verify your API key has the required permissions:
   - For NRQL queries: `NRQL query` permission
   - For APM data: `APM` read permissions
   - For alerts: `Alerts` read/write permissions

2. Create a new API key with broader permissions if needed

See [docs/mcp-inspector-setup.md](docs/mcp-inspector-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### Architecture

The server follows a modular architecture with:

- **Client Layer**: Handles New Relic API communication
- **Tools Layer**: Implements MCP tool specifications
- **Server Layer**: Manages MCP protocol and tool routing

Each tool:

- Has a single, focused purpose
- Validates inputs using Zod schemas
- Returns structured, typed responses
- Includes comprehensive error handling

| Project | Status | Transport(s) | Deployments | APM Apps | Metrics | Alerts | Synthetics | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| This project (newrelic-mcp) | Active | NerdGraph + REST v2 | Create/List/Delete | List (NerdGraph + REST) | Host names + timeslices (REST) | Policies + Incidents (NG + REST) | List/Create (browser) | Comprehensive tests and docs |

Planned enhancements (based on REST v2 catalog and user demand):
- Alerts: violations and conditions management via REST where available
- Metrics: broader app‑level metrics endpoints (names/data) beyond per‑host
- Additional REST coverage: labels, key transactions, mobile apps (prioritized by feedback)
