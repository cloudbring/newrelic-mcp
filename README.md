## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Connection Issues</summary>

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Verify your API key is valid:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -d '{"query":"{ actor { user { email } } }"}'
   ```

2. Check that your Account ID is correct
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
4. Check the MCP client logs for detailed error messages

</details>

<details>
<summary>Permission Errors</summary>

If you receive permission errors:

1. Verify your API key has the required permissions:
   - For NRQL queries: `NRQL query` permission
   - For APM data: `APM` read permissions
   - For alerts: `Alerts` read/write permissions

2. Create a new API key with broader permissions if needed

- **Gherkin** for BDD testing
- **Evalite** for LLM response validation

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run BDD tests only
npm run test:bdd

USE_REAL_ENV=true npm test
```

### Debugging

Use the MCP Inspector to test and debug the server:

```bash
# Run with MCP Inspector
npm run inspect

# Run with development server
npm run inspect:dev

# Run with environment variables
npm run inspect:env
```

See [docs/mcp-inspector-setup.md](docs/mcp-inspector-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### Architecture

The server follows a modular architecture with:

- **Client Layer**: Handles New Relic API communication
- **Tools Layer**: Implements MCP tool specifications
- **Server Layer**: Manages MCP protocol and tool routing

Each tool:

- Has a single, focused purpose
- Validates inputs using Zod schemas
- Returns structured, typed responses
- Includes comprehensive error handling
